# Mission-to-Mars

### Overview

The Mission to Mars repository utilizes a scraping.py file to import scraping functions to app.py which then creates (if not already created) and updates a Mongo Database known as the mars database. Then app.py renders an html file for flask to display the relevant mars data to a browser. With the creation of a webpage capable of scraping new mars data, any space enthusiast can get updates on the latest mars news.
